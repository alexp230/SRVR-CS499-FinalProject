# CS499-FinalProject
Final Project created by myself and five other students. 

A local website allowing users to theoretically order freshly made healthy food with a subscription plan and download the recipes for each meal. Users are able to create accounts, login and out, and also choose a subscription plan that best accommodate their preferences. The project also incorporates AWS througe AWS Database Services, allowing for realtime updates and zero conflicts amongst the contributors.
